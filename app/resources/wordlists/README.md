# Word Lists
The word lists in this folder are simple attempts to find common words and exclude them from redaction by default.

## English
The English list came from here: http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/wordlists/english/

The list seems to have a lot of good words with quite a bit of nonsense mixed in. It would be great to replace this with only real words and slang.

### Names
English name list came from here: http://www.outpost9.com/files/wordlists.html

Slightly modified removing 2 character names
